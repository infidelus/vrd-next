# Changelog

All notable changes to VRD Next are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- **TMDB episode picker.** Double-click a matched row in the TV renamer to choose
  the exact season and episode from a dialog that fetches the show's seasons and
  episodes from TMDB. Ctrl-click to select two episodes for a two-parter, use
  "Change show…" if the auto-match was wrong, and Season 0 is presented as
  "Specials".
- **Pixel cropping.** A new per-profile option to remove letterbox or pillarbox
  black bars. Because the bars are baked into the picture, cropping re-encodes the
  video (the only non-lossless step in the tool); the normal lossless cutting path
  is untouched when cropping is off.
  - **Auto-detect** finds the bars per file at export time, or set **Fixed pixels**
    by hand.
  - A **preview window** shows a real frame from the open recording with the crop
    shaded in, a slider to skim for a frame to crop against, live edge adjustment,
    and an Auto-detect button.
  - The re-encode matches the source's own bitrate as a ceiling and uses constant
    quality (CRF), so a cropped file is never larger than the source and is usually
    smaller.
  - The **scan type is preserved** — an interlaced source stays interlaced (with
    its original field order), a progressive source stays progressive.
  - Cropping works in the watcher/batch pipeline as well as manual exports, with a
    proper progress bar and accurate timing for the re-encode stage.

### Changed

- The TV renamer now files Season 0 episodes into a "Specials" folder.
- Versioning tidied up: the old build-number field has been retired in favour of a
  `build_stamp()` derived from the version string.
